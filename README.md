This is a (mostly) accurate recreation of the battle system and mechanics from UNDERTALE by Toby Fox
The fight, however, focuses on a character who, although present in UNDERTALE, does not ever have a fight of their own. Attack patterns and dialogue are original.
The character in question, Flowey, is a soulless creature of evil and violence. His motto, 'Kill or be Killed' has brought fear and pain to those around him.
However, he does what he does because he is bored. Flowey is aware his life is a game. He is aware of the player's ability to reset, to change fate, to play the whole game again.
In this timeline, the player has played the game so many times, giving the characters happy endings, sad endings, awful endings, that Flowey is even bored of that. He no longer wishes
for you to play anymore. He just wants you to put the game to rest. But you're not going to do that, are you? You have to see what happens if you continue.

In this game, you can FIGHT or SPARE to win. The path of violence is a decision, not a necessity. You may ACT to learn information and use ITEMs to heal.
